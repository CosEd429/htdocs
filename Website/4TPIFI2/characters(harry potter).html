          Harry James Potter is the son of the wizard James Potter and his wife
          Lily. Due to the fact that he is the only person in history to have
          survived the Killing Curse, he is possibly the most well-known wizard
          of his time. The curse, however, destroyed Lord Voldemort's body, who
          had attacked him and killed his parents.
